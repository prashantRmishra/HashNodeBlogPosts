# Shortest Distance from source to all other nodes in the graph where the edge weight is 1 unit

```java
 private void shortestPath(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj,int N,int src){
	// we have to find the shortest Path from given source to all the 
	//other nodes in the graph.
	//let's initialize all the distances from the source as infinity.
	int distance[] = new int[N];
	for(int i =0;i<N;i++) distance[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
	// we will put source distance as 0 as its a starting point
	distance[src] = 0;
	//now we will use breadth first search for finding the shortest distance from 
	//source to all other nodes
	Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
	q.add(src);
	while(!q.isEmpty()){

		//getting distance of all the adjacent nodes of current node
		for(Integer i : adj.get(node)){
